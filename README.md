restoration of a Commordore PET 2001 (my first computer!)

I bought my first computer in 1977 and it finally arrived in August 1978.  That computer was a Commodore PET 2001.  
I still have the computer and I am in the process of restoring it.  This repository is both a document of that 
restoration process and also contains some tools and docs that may be helpful to others interested in restoring
other PETs.
